Welcome to Keeping the BEAT's documentation! NEW!!
============================================

The Bayesian Evidence Analysis Tool (BEAT) is a Python-based code for measuring and dissecting multi-component emission lines. BEAT was designed to analyze large numbers of spectra (i.e. large surveys or IFU spectroscopy) automatically and determine the number of physical kinematic components in a given set of emission lines. BEAT utilizes the `MultiNest sampling algorithm <https://github.com/farhanferoz/MultiNest>`_  to compute Bayesian statistics and determine the number of components for each fit.



In-depth descriptions of BEAT can be found in the following papers: `Fischer et al. 2017 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834...30F/abstract>`_ (see the Appendix), `Falcone et al. 2024 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971...17F/abstract/>`_   (see Section 3).
