The Bayesian Evidence Analysis Tool (BEAT) is a Python-based code for measuring and dissecting multi-component emission lines. BEAT was designed to analyze large numbers of spectra (i.e. large surveys or IFU spectroscopy) automatically and determine the number of physical kinematic components in a given set of emission lines. BEAT utilizes the [MultiNest sampling algorithm](https://github.com/farhanferoz/MultiNest) to compute Bayesian statistics and determine the number of components for each fit.

<!--frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibiting outflowing winds. -->

In-depth descriptions of BEAT can be found in the following papers: [Fischer et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834...30F/abstract) (see the Appendix), [Falcone et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971...17F/abstract) (see Section 3).
